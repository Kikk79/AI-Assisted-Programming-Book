# My Python Project

This is a Python project that consists of multiple files and allows functions in different files to refer to each other.

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
my-python-project
├── src
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── module1.py
│   └── module2.py
├── tests
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── test_main.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```

## Files Description

- `src/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that marks the `src` directory as a Python package.

- `src/main.py`: This file is the entry point of the program. It contains the main function that is executed when the program is run. It may import and call functions from `module1.py` and `module2.py`.

- `src/module1.py`: This file contains functions that can be imported and used by other files. It may import functions from `module2.py`.

- `src/module2.py`: This file contains functions that can be imported and used by other files. It may import functions from `module1.py`.

- `tests/__init__.py`: This file is an empty file that marks the `tests` directory as a Python package.

- `tests/test_main.py`: This file contains unit tests for the functions in `main.py`. It may import functions from `module1.py` and `module2.py` to test their functionality.

- `requirements.txt`: This file lists the dependencies required for the project. It specifies the Python packages and their versions that need to be installed.

- `README.md`: This file contains the documentation for the project, providing information about its purpose, usage, and any other relevant details.

## Usage

To run the program, execute the `main.py` file located in the `src` directory.

To run the unit tests, execute the `test_main.py` file located in the `tests` directory.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies. You can install them using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`:

- Dependency 1
- Dependency 2
- Dependency 3
